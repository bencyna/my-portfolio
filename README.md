## Description

This project has been developed to provide a portfolio for potential future employees to gain an insight of who I am as a person and what I could contribute to a company. I have included my old portfolios made using bootsrap and vanilla javascript. I have added tailwind to this updated version to ensure a more authentic and cleaner layout. My portfolio showcases my current learning capabilities and ability to learn new skills. I have added python, c++ and PHP to the list of my capabilities.

## Installation

Added a reset.css for cross-browser compatiability, bootstrap for implementation of existing css, style.css for further styling changes. There was also use of google fonts and viewport tags for styling and mobile responsiveness. To put these together I also made the grid bootstrap system for each page, added images, contact form, and clickable links to my past projects and resume, linkedIn and github profiles.

Now a react app, this web-page utilises react state to render and re-render my previous projects

## Usage
