# w2-homework-responsiveportfolio
## Motivation
This project has been developed to provide a portfolio for potential future employees to gain an insight of who I am as a person but also what I could contribute to a company. Using bootsrap allows us to utlise the pre-exisitng css frameworks to allow for mobile responsive code. This project showcases my current learning capabilities and ability to learn new skills over time. The use of comments is reduced to improtant features to explain my thought process during challenges that required some critical thinking to overcome.

## Installation

 -reset.css for cross-browser compatability 
 -bootsrap for implementation of existing css framework
