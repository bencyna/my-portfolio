## Installation

Added a reset.css for cross-browser compatiability, bootstrap for implementation of existing css, style.css for further styling changes. There was also use of google fonts and viewport tags for styling and mobile responsiveness. To put these together I also made the grid bootstrap system for each page, added images, contact form, and clickable links to my past projects and resume, linkedIn and github profiles
